Tracks your progress towards a goal, sample by sample, and projects
time of likely success.  Makes the chart using the Google
Visualization API.

Instructions:
- Enter the level of your goal.
- Enter several samples.
- Click "Draw!"
- Look at the graph.

The graph will estimate when you will meet your goal, in two ways: by
projecting both from first sample to last, and from the last two.

This was just a learning exercise for the Google Visualization API, so
it's not great code, especially WRT "unobtrusive JavaScript".  I also
did it a long time ago, around 2009 or so, so forgive the JS!

Eventual planned features:
- Log in (yes this will require much more than one simple page)
- Clean up code, making JS unobtrusive
- Store your samples
- Timestamp each sample
- Show timestamp of projected success
- Detect increasing progress

You can't use it straight from Github, so see the demo at:
